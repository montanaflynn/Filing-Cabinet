Filing-Cabinet

OSX File Organizing Shell Script, Maybe more?

## Features: 

- Creates a tar'd and <del>feathered</del> gzipped backup.
- Organizes your files into new directories dated by date modified. 

## Problems:

- Only works once, the second go around puts dated directories into new ones.
- Put's the newly created backup inside the current days directory.
